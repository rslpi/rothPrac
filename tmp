git branch -a  ;; local and remote

rothPrac (master)$ git branch
* master
rothPrac (master)$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
rothPrac (master)$ 

git push --all origin ;; even branches that you took from the clone

rothPrac (fooBranch)$ git push --all origin

rothPrac (fooBranch)$ git branch -a
* fooBranch
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/fooBranch
  remotes/origin/master
rothPrac (fooBranch)$ 

push --all worked, since we see:
remotes/origin/fooBranch

git checkout master
ls ;; back our original master; no file will have been added.

rothPrac (fooBranch)$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
rothPrac (master)$ 

see --track doc from fox.


Ruchen has experience with fox_idol and merging git:
To reiterate: git clone <fox idol> to local machine, branch from your local machine to local machine, commit on local macine; thanks.

With Git, the crucial action is no longer the commit; it is the merge. Anyone can clone a repository and commit to the clone. The owner of the repository is given the choice of merging changes back. Alternatively, developers can push changes back to the repository. I'll explore only the latter, authorized-push model.

git mv, add, commit â€¦
git branch master ;; 

rothPrac (master)$ git push origin anotherBranch


rothPrac (master)$ git push origin anotherBranch
